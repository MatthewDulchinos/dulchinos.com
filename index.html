      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>I'm a software developer with a passion for AI, Machine Learning, and Microservice Architecture. I got my degree from Union College where I double majored in Computer Science and Theatre, but I have been coding ever since I was a little kid, from creating a text based adventure on my TI calculator, to attempting (somewhat) successfully to make an orange juice making machine.</p>
      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>Over the past few years, I have worked on various projects ranging from small-scale web applications to full-stack development. My work includes creating cutting edge machine learning programs, singlehandily refactoring existing infrastrucure to be more efficent & more reliable, and taking several microservices from idea to deployed in a Kubernetes environment. I have experience in and can succeed at both creating microservice programs of the future, as well as understanding and improving older monolothic programs. </p>
      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>In my free time, I am a competitive pinball player, love gardening, and hanging out with my lovely cat Lucy.</p>

      <h3>Code Lookup Tool</h3>
      <p>This project is a basic API that you can use to look up descriptions of codes, search for codes based off key phrases, and ask chatGPT what a code means. Below I have two of the sample APIs which let you look up a specific code, and look up key phrases to find what codes relate to them. Check out my github for instructions on how to run locally, as well as the additional APIs.</p>

      <h3>Boardgame Ranking Predictor</h3>
      <p>This project was a silly idea to pratice my data science skills. The model makes predictions of a game's BoardGameGeek Rating based off of information like the number of players it's best at, and whether it was kickstarted or not.</p>

      <p>Currently the model has a terrible accuracy, topping out at mid 60s. This could be potentially improved by using more information if found. Though to be honest, I think this would be a waste to pursue seriously. Board game ratings would not make too much sense to be tied to certain static traits like the minimum number of players who can play it.</p>

      <h3>Shakespeare Analyzer</h3>
      <p>Brevity is the soul of wit, or is it? In this project I asked the question, "Are the smartest characters the most succinct?" I looked at look at character's average words per line, and found that there was seemingly no correlation between a character's inteligence, and a character's average words per line.</p>

      <p>Take this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MatthewDulchinos/ShakespeareAnalyzer/master/Images/MainCharacters.png">image</a> where Hamlet, argueably the smartest character in the play, speaks just about the same average words per line as the fool Polonius. Obviously there is a lot more that could be done for a more in depth analysis, which is briefed in my readme, but I think this is a fun indisciplinary project to get to do with Shakespeare's work</p>
